### Instructions

- This is REST API based jwt example.
- When you run the program first time the default user is created which is 
    - username = username
    - password = 123
- you can also create users and roles using corresponding repositories<br>


- In the given example i send the JWT token to the user which is valid for a day. when he try to access the protected URL with token we made him authenticated through JWT token 

- In our case  we are sending the token as a body of responseEntity but you can also set this token into client's browser
- Cookie example is also present but you need to uncomment this if you want to use it


### Permitted URL'S

- localhost:8080/login = for authentication permitted to all
 
- localhost:8080/ping  = secured URL only accessible by ADMIN
